  there EveryBody. This is My first Tutorial on PSC. So if this is Not Good Enough 
  Then Please Don't Get Angry. Anyway I had Tried to make it as Good as Possible. 
  I have used too much graphics and animations to make it look better But You 
  can understand that It is there to Show all the Graphics related technics to 
  You people. If Your PC is a little slower then You will have some problem with 
  it otherwise You can enjoy it on faster computers. I have made it on &quot;AMD 
  Athlon 1700+ &quot;. It works Great here. I had Used the Primitive type of search 
  engine in splash screen, I could have done it by using API's but they would 
  not make this tutorial look better. I had tried to make it as simple as possible 
  for all of those who are not much familiar with API's and other Object-Oriented 
  tasks. One more thing I would like to tell is that If You liked this Tutorial 
  then Please Vote for me or email me. That way I would Know that how many of 
  You over there want me to make more of like this. I haven't covered some topics 
  over here But in Future I would like to cover ADODC, Active-X, Dll's, Add-ins,Techniques 
  for Applying Shareware Restrictions, Encryption and other advanced subjects. 
  If I get a good response from this then I will be encouraged to do this kind 
  of projects in Future. If you are from those who didn't liked this then also 
  please let me know by E-mail or Post a Comment. I will try to do better in coming 
  Tutorials. Plus there is also a Bunch of People who don't make anything, But 
  Posts rude comments on the people who dare to submit their Projects. I would 
  like to tell them that Please don't Dis-Courage Programmers they want Encouragement 
  and Support, They can also perform wonderful things if they are given a suitable 
  Environment and Support for Working. For those very few People who really care 
  and makes PSC a Good place I would like to Thank You. OK that's all. Hoping 
  that you would like this Tutorial and It will be helpful to You in some way.</font></p>
